# Mini-Project-1-SHRDC-

This is a mini project for AI & ML Competence for Industry 4.0 with Selangor Human Resources Department Centre (SHRDC).

Linear regression model is used on diabetes dataset from scikit-learn to perform predictions. Numpy and Pandas module are used to perform preprocessing on the datasets before train into the model. The cost function which is MSE, RMSE and MAE are calculated to evaluate the model's performnce. Overall the model performed badly on predictiing the data.
